# Amethyst Runtime Compat

This mod carries runtime-side compatibility fixes that are safer to ship as ModTheSpire patches than as direct game-jar edits.

## Included fixes

1. `FontScaleCompatPatches`
Adjusts `FontHelper.prepFont` so launcher-configured text scaling is applied consistently during MTS launches while staying independent from the launcher UI-scale slider. This addresses the symptom where text sizing only followed the base game's `Bigger Text` behavior or got unintentionally magnified again when UI scale was increased. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `FontScaleCompatPatches`.

2. `ResolutionDropdownCompatPatches`
Guards the in-game settings resolution dropdown on Android-compatible runtimes. When no desktop-compatible resolution list can be built, the dropdown is replaced with a single `N/A` entry and resolution changes become a no-op instead of crashing. The patch also normalizes stale dropdown selection and scroll-window state during settings rendering so toggling graphics options cannot leave the placeholder dropdown pointing past its only row and crash inside `DropdownMenu.layoutRowsBelow`. Type: crash fix implemented by `ResolutionDropdownCompatPatches`.

3. `DuelistCompatPatches`
Short-circuits a few Duelist dynamic/base-value lookups so they reuse current card state instead of going through slower or less stable reflection-heavy paths.

4. `CharacterPreviewReuseCompatPatches`
Adds hooks used by `RuntimeMemoryDiagnostics` to track main-menu and character-select preview lifecycle, including preview reuse for modded characters and per-selected-character recreate summaries when the menu has to rebuild a modded preview instead of reusing it.

5. `RuntimeMemoryDiagnosticsPatches`
Adds runtime hooks for update/create-character/start-over/reset/dispose so memory diagnostics can observe long-session behavior without modifying the base game directly, including menu-cycle texture/FBO summaries and owner/source hotspot attribution suitable for normal play sessions.

6. `FrierenTextureCacheCompatPatches`
Intercepts `ImageMaster.loadImage` for Frieren slot-library textures and reuses one `Texture` per resource path instead of letting `Slot`, `SlotBgLibrary`, and `refreshSlot()` repeatedly allocate duplicates. This targets the severe GPU-memory growth that happens when Frieren rebuilds the full slot background library on each return to the main menu. Type: compatibility workaround for a third-party texture leak.

7. `DownfallMainMenuAtlasCompatPatches`
Intercepts `downfall.patches.MainMenuColorPatch.setMainMenuBG(TitleBackground)` and reuses a singleton Downfall main-menu `TextureAtlas` instead of constructing a fresh atlas on every menu rebuild. This targets the repeated `title.atlas` / `title.jpg` GPU-memory leak seen when bouncing back to the main menu. Type: compatibility workaround for a third-party texture leak.

8. `HinaCharacterRenderCompatPatches`
Downsizes Blue Archive Hina's offscreen 3D character render target from its desktop-style supersampled framebuffer to a mobile-safe framebuffer, keeps the helper's original logical camera scale, and replaces the original mipmap generation path with linear filtering during the final blit. It also caches reflected helper fields/methods, reuses the framebuffer `TextureRegion`, moves final-blit filter setup to framebuffer creation, and throttles render fallback logging so the compatibility path does not add per-frame reflection/allocation/logging overhead. This addresses the symptom where Hina's in-run 3D model renders as a blank character or at the wrong size on Android-compatible runtimes after the oversized framebuffer is pressure-downscaled or the desktop mipmap path misbehaves, while avoiding frame-time spikes from the workaround itself. The fix is controlled by the launcher's runtime compatibility switch for Hina character rendering. Type: compatibility workaround and performance fix for third-party mobile rendering assumptions implemented by `HinaCharacterRenderCompatPatches`.

9. `UiScaleCompatPatches`
Uses the launcher's UI-size setting to dynamically rewrite base-game and mod reads of `Settings.isMobile`, so enlarged mobile-style layout branches are reused without turning on the real mobile HUD mode. Main-menu classes and speech-bubble VFX classes are intentionally excluded so the title screen and dialogue bubbles keep their desktop behavior instead of picking up mobile-only spacing and text placement. This addresses the symptom where the only built-in way to enlarge the interface was the native mobile HUD toggle, which also changes global runtime state and can break modded screens. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `UiScaleCompatPatches` together with `MobileUiLayoutClassPatcher`.

10. `BurningEliteFlameCompatPatches`
Enlarges the burning-elite emerald flame marker when the launcher's Larger UI mode reuses mobile map-node scaling. This addresses the symptom where the elite node grows with the larger mobile-style layout but its flame VFX stays at desktop size and becomes hard to notice. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `BurningEliteFlameCompatPatches`.

11. `CharacterOptionRelicKeywordCompatPatches`
Reapplies BaseMod's starter-relic multiword-keyword normalization when mobile layout handling is active inside `CharacterOption.renderRelics`. This addresses the symptom where character-select relic descriptions leak raw keyword prefixes such as `spearandshield:` after the launcher's Larger UI mode reroutes the screen through the mobile single-relic branch. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `CharacterOptionRelicKeywordCompatPatches`.

12. `JacketNoAnoKoElectrocardiogramCompatPatches`
Rewrites JacketNoAnoKo's `ElectrocardiogramLoeweEffect` shader sources to GLES 100 at runtime on Android-compatible runtimes, installs the compiled shader back into the original effect, and lets the original render method draw the visual effect. If the rewritten shader still fails, it falls back to preserving the effect timing and sound trigger while skipping only the render, so the `Inspiration`/tuning card can continue resolving its selected gameplay effect without crashing. This addresses the repeated `Shader compilation failed: Error: shader version mismatch` crash at `ElectrocardiogramLoeweEffect.update(ElectrocardiogramLoeweEffect.java:64)`. Type: crash fix implemented by `JacketNoAnoKoElectrocardiogramCompatPatches`.

13. `JacketNoAnoKoJesterFormCompatPatches`
Reimplements JacketNoAnoKo's `JesterForm.use` and `JesterFormPower.atStartOfTurnPostDraw` on Android-compatible runtimes so the gameplay actions still apply while creation of `CombinedFireworksSpotlightEffect` is guarded. If the rewritten shader compiles, the original fireworks/spotlight effect is preserved; if shader setup still fails, only that visual effect is skipped. This addresses the `Shader compilation failed: Error: shader version mismatch` crash at `CombinedFireworksSpotlightEffect.<init>(CombinedFireworksSpotlightEffect.java:40)` when playing `jacketnoanokomod:JesterForm` or when its power triggers on later turns. Type: crash fix implemented by `JacketNoAnoKoJesterFormCompatPatches`.

14. `NativeTouchscreenAllowlistPatches`
Rewrites selected base-game reads of `Settings.isTouchScreen` so the launcher's native touchscreen compatibility allowlist can switch between two runtime modes: `vanilla_allowlist`, which hides global touchscreen semantics from mods and only restores verified vanilla touch-confirm flows, and `global`, which falls back to the original native touchscreen behavior. In allowlist mode the patch keeps the touch indicator plus the vanilla shop purchase, card-reward selection/confirm, campfire, combat targeted-card dragging/release, and boss-relic confirm paths available when launcher touch input is enabled, but leaves most mod code on desktop-style semantics. This addresses the symptom where enabling native touchscreen mode globally causes modded screens to enter untested confirm-button state machines or touch-only obtain flows, prevents vanilla card rewards from falling back to desktop direct-pick behavior in hybrid mode, and keeps targeted cards from entering the desktop single-target drag branch instead of canceling on touch release. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `NativeTouchscreenAllowlistPatches`.

15. `TouchscreenButtonStateCleanupPatches`
Clears stale `Hitbox.clicked` and `Hitbox.clickStarted` state when common confirm/cancel/proceed/peek buttons are hidden or hidden instantly, while intentionally leaving `show`/`showInstantly` untouched so an active press can survive until release. This addresses the symptom where touchscreen confirm buttons can re-fire on later frames or after screen transitions because the original click state was never consumed or reset by modded UI flows, without breaking vanilla buttons that repeatedly call `show()` while waiting for a click. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `TouchscreenButtonStateCleanupPatches`.

16. `MainMenuTouchLayoutCompatPatches`
Restores the large-button and large name-edit visuals that the vanilla main menu normally uses for touch/mobile presentation, but only inside the main menu's own layout branches. In `vanilla_allowlist` mode this keeps the home-screen buttons, name-edit hitbox, and save-slot prompt from shrinking back to desktop sizing just because global touchscreen semantics were hidden from mods, while still avoiding a full main-menu touchscreen interaction rollback. This addresses the symptom where enabling the native touchscreen compatibility allowlist makes the title-screen options noticeably smaller than before. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `MainMenuTouchLayoutCompatPatches`.

17. `ExpectedGameExitPatches`
Writes the launcher's expected-exit marker before vanilla main-menu Quit and LibGDX `LwjglApplication.exit()` paths continue into native teardown. This addresses the symptom where an intentional game exit reaches `application_shutdown` but Android still records a native `SIGABRT` such as `FORTIFY: pthread_mutex_lock called on a destroyed mutex`, causing the launcher to show a crash recovery page on the next return. Type: crash-report false-positive fix implemented by `ExpectedGameExitPatches` and `ExpectedGameExitMarker`.

18. `DebugRuntimeCrashPatches`
Adds a debug-only runtime crash trigger controlled by the launcher's `amethyst.debug.force_runtime_crash` system property so device verification can confirm expected-exit suppression does not hide real gameplay/update crashes. It is inert in normal release configuration because the launcher only forwards the property from debug preferences. Type: diagnostic hook implemented by `DebugRuntimeCrashPatches`.

19. `TouchscreenSingleTargetCancelPatches`
Cancels the current combat targeted-card selection when a native touchscreen blank tap or release would otherwise promote an already selected targeted card into the base game's single-target mode or directly call `playCard()` with no hovered monster, and also cleans up any blank click/release that still returns from `AbstractPlayer.updateSingleTargetInput` in target-selection mode. This addresses the symptom where cards such as `Strike` can remain stuck in midair after tapping the card and then tapping empty combat space under the launcher's default hybrid touchscreen setting; tapping a monster is not intercepted and still continues through the original target/play-card path. Type: gameplay/runtime fix implemented by `TouchscreenSingleTargetCancelPatches`.

20. `DisplaySettingsPromptCompatPatches`
Replaces the base game's display-settings restart prompt with a launcher-specific warning telling players not to change graphics quality in-game and to use launcher settings instead. This addresses the symptom where changing quality-related options in the in-game settings shows the misleading vanilla message that a game restart is enough for display-setting changes to take effect, even though Amethyst-managed graphics options should be adjusted before launch. Type: compatibility workaround implemented by `DisplaySettingsPromptCompatPatches`.
